# arkbot
Brute-force solver for the NES game Arkanoid.

Rather than try to emulate the game, the core Arkanoid game engine is re-implemented in C++ so it can be simulated as fast as possible. The brute-force evaluator runs the engine with a variety of rules and settings to try and find optimal solutions to Arkanoid levels.
